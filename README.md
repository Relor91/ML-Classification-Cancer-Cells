"A Machine Learning **SVM** algorithm that predicts if patient's cells are benign or malignant"

* Created a **Support Vector Machines** algorithm that predicts if patient's cells are benign or malignant(F1-Score **97%**) given Clump thickness, Uniformity of cell size, Uniformity of cell shape, Marginal adhesion, Single epithelial cell size, Bare nuclei, Bland chromatin, Normal nucleoli and Mitoses.
* **Pre-Processed** the data and dropped categorical values under Bare nuclei variable.
* Split the data with a **Test Size** of 0.2.
* Optimized the SVM by using an **Polynomial Kernel** to obtain the best model.
* Plotted a **Confusion Matrix** of the **Model Results**.
